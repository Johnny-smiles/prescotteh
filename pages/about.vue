                <strong>{{ siteConfig.siteName }}</strong> began as a small electrical shop in {{ siteConfig.location.city }}, {{ siteConfig.location.state }} back in 1963.
                Today, the company combines licensed electricians and HVAC technicians under one roof so you never have to juggle multiple contractors to keep your property running.

                We handle panel work, lighting design, dedicated circuits, and code correctionsâ€”then stay onsite to install or service the furnaces, air conditioners, and mini-splits that power your comfort.
                Every project starts with clear options, a written estimate, and a tidy job site. It is the same way we have earned trust from homeowners, schools, and local businesses throughout the St. Croix River Valley.
