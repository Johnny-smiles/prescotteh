- **subheadline:** short supportive phrase or differentiator  
- **intro:** 80–120 word paragraph describing the brand, city/region, and offerings  

**Tone:** confident, plain-language, and friendly.  
- Sound local, not corporate.  
- Include exactly one “near me” or “near you” mention.  
- Reference 1–2 neighborhoods only if present in intake.  

**Return JSON:**
