# FAQ Content Brief

Write concise, natural sentences. Each section should stay under ~100 words total.  
Create **4–6 FAQs** based on the intake niche, services, and city.  
Keep each answer short (1–3 sentences) — focus on clarity and reassurance, not sales.  
Avoid filler phrases like “we pride ourselves” or “our team of experts.”
